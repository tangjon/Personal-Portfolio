<h1>Goal</h1>
<p>
  The application goal is to aid parent volunteer keep track of badges and progress of Scout members of the 33rd Scout
  Group through object oriented programing. When members were to move sections their progress would not be lost and
  progress and achievements can be revisited.
</p>
<h1>Detail</h1>
<p>
  Uses Jekyll to host the site and Google Firebase as a real-time database. Javascript, css, html is also used. Android
  style is provided by using Minimal Desing Light css. Developed to track Outdoor Adventure Skills badges of members in
  the 33rd KC Scout Group in real-time. Goal was to try to mimic excel functionality when it comes to tracking badges
  with excel. However, this system allows object tracking and data can persist through the years without the creation of
  a new excel document every year.
